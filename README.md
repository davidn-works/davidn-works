I'm passionate about cybersecurity and IT. I love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I‚Äôve put into enhancing security operations and processes! I'm also interested in tech sales as well! Feel free to reach out!

I also have extensive experience in customer support and administration tasks as well!
